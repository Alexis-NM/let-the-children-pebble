# Let The Children Pebble

A Pebble watchface inspired by **school notebooks** ✏️📓  
Designed for back-to-school season, this watchface shows the time and date as if handwritten in a notebook, with a **left margin**, **Seyes-style grid background**, and the **Permanent Marker** Google Font.

A fun twist: a **grade (A+ to F)** is displayed in the top-right corner, reflecting your Pebble's current battery level 🔋.
